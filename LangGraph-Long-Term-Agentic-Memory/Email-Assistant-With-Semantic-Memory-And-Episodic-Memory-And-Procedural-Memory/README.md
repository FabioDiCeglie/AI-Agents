# Email Assistant with Semantic + Episodic + Procedural Memory

We previously built an email assistant that:

Classifies incoming messages (respond, ignore, notify)
Uses human-in-the-loop to refine the assistant's ability to classify emails
Drafts responses
Schedules meetings
Uses memory to remember details from previous emails

Now, we'll add procedural memory that allows the user to update instructions for using the calendar and email writing tools.
