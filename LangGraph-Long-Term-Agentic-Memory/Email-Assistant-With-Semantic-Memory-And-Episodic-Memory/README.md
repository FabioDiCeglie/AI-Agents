# Email Assistant with Semantic + Episodic Memory

We previously built an email assistant that:
Classifies incoming messages (respond, ignore, notify)
Drafts responses
Schedules meetings
Uses memory to remember details from previous emails

Now, we'll add human-in-the-loop following the triage step to better refine the assistant's ability to classify emails.
